# Style is not what is expected for asn1 (e.g., no header in this
# comment), and this Makefile is not guaranteed to work with your
# code.  Feel free to use it as a template, though. Don't forget
# that you'll need to change draw0 to draw1.

# -lm used here only so Makefile looks closer to proper asn1 Makefile
